------------------Assignment SURVEYPOLLING resource client-----------------

* First let me say that since the last assignment, It took a lot of effort to use to many of the feature. 
It is very difficult to understand the requirements from day to night, so it is late very sometimes

* However Firstly, I was created a simple work platform before make website with SURVEYPOLLING. And one more thing has to be created, that is the backend

* Some of these features have to be added, they are react-helmet, react-hook-form, react-hooks, react-captcha, axios, tanstake query, react-stripe etc.

* It took 7 days as it was very hard and big project, It also has some features to work on, But i haven't done yet

* Now Finally after everything, The big project finished in at this time. After all, it is very nice to add a lot of feature to a project.

 Create a readme with what challenges I have faced for the backend.
